# Tokenizer

This goal of this project was to become familiar with coding in the C language especially when it comes to removing delimiters and handling user input.

## Files Included

* prog1_1.c - This program will take the input of a user and remove all the whitespace from it using strtok(). It then prints one per new line surrounded by "=".

* prog1_2.c - This program follows the framework of #1 but instead of reprinting each token on its own line the program will determine if the token contains numbers or letters and inform the user accordingly.

* prog1_3.c - Similar to #2 but this program will limit the user to only 2 tokens.

* prog1_4.c - Includes all past improvements but also limits the characters a user can enter to 20. In addition the program will also continue to run until the 'Quit' command is entered by the user.
